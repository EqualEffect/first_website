        <div id="boxes"><font color=#FFFFFF>Hello, my name is Anthony. This is the homepage for my HTML class. Though I don't have a spouse
        or children of any kind. I do have a few pets I would like you to know of. I have a Tortoise, his name
        is Bowser and he like to kidnap princesses. I also have two dogs. One German Shepherd and her name is
        Sosa and an Australian Shepherd named Kale <em>( yes, like the veggie )</em> This page will definitely
        change as I begin to learn more and more about HTML and want to make my website look better and better</font></div>
        
        <h2 id="titles"><b>Interests</b></h2>
        
        <div id="boxes"><font color=#FFFFFF>I'm interested in many things. Computers happen to have a big role in many of them. I enjoy programming,
            playing games and learning new things by browsing the Internet. I also love sports. I rock climb
            on a frequent basis. Play Frisbee, Football, Basketball and Golf with my friends as often as I can.
            I have plenty of other interests.</font> </div>
        
        <h2 id="titles"><b>Work and School</b></h2>
        
        <div id="boxes"><font color=#FFFFFF>I work full time and go to school full time as well. It is really challenging but I'm getting
        through it. I work as IT in the Help Desk at WCF. Workers Compensation Fund is a great place to 
        work that allows me to follow my interest in the field of Computer Science. I go to School at
        SLCC and will be transferring to Weber to get my Bachelors in Computer Science. <em>hopefully</em>
        There is quite a big struggle to keep up with work which I am having constant overtime, School and
        trying to keep a semi social life style. </font></div>
