        Hello. This is not a very exciting document.
        I bet you were expecting <em> poetry </em> or 
        some kind of <strong> exciting <br> fact </strong> about the Internet
        and the World Wide Web.
        
        <p> Sorry, no such luck. This document does contain examples of HTML markup,
            for example, here is an "unordered list": 
        <ul>
            <li> One item in the list</li>
            <li> Second item in the list </li>
            <li> Third item in the list
            that goes on and on and on to indicate that the lists 
            can wrap right around the page and still be nicely formatted 
            by the browsers </li>
            <li>The final item on the list</li></ul>
        
        <p> Lists are exciting. You can also have orders lists ( the items are numbers) and 
            Description lists.
            
        <hr>
        <p>And you can draw horizontal lines, which are useful for dividing sections.
        </p>
